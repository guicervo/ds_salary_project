If you or a friend is interested in applying for a teaching position at TEP, join us for a virtual information session with TEP's Senior Leaders. Learn more about the teacher application process and what it's like to teach at TEP.

Please RSVP here!
To Apply:
The first stage of the process is the application below. In order to be considered, you must submit an application that consists of all four components: 1 - Resume, 2 - Cover letter, 3 - Evidence of student learning, and 4 -Original Curricular tool. The requirements for each of the four components are specified in detail below.
1. RESUME: Please submit an up-to-date resume.
2. COVER LETTER: Please submit a well-written cover letter.
3. EVIDENCE OF STUDENT LEARNING: Submit one of the following three options:
Option A: (HIGHLY PREFERRED)
We understand you may be unable to provide a recorded video of you teaching in a classroom setting. If you do not have a video with students in the classroom (per the instructions below) you may still submit a video of yourself teaching. Get creative! You may include a video of you teaching (a) a lesson with/for no students, (b) a lesson of you teaching family members, (c) or a lesson for students virtually. We're excited to see your creativity. The video must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the teaching that occurs in the lesson. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative. The video may be submitted in any format, but a link to a video posted online is preferred.
An unedited video clip (maximum 15 minutes) of you teaching in a classroom setting (preferred) or a small-group setting. It is preferred that the students be in the same grade-level as the TEP teaching position for which you are applying, though this is not a strict requirement. The video may contain only one continuous, unedited clip (i.e. do not splice together multiple clips from different points in the lesson). The clip does not need to show an entire lesson; a brief lesson segment is perfectly acceptable. The video must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the teaching and learning that occurs in the lesson and may offer an explanation as to what occurred prior to and subsequent to the clip. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative. The video may be submitted in any format, but a link to a video posted online is preferred.
Option B: A portfolio of student work that demonstrates the progress of at least two specific students that you have taught. The portfolio must contain a minimum of two work products for each student (for a minimum of four work products) completed at different points in time during the period when each student was in your class. The portfolio must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the progress that each student demonstrates. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.
Option C: Assessment data for at least one entire class of students that you have taught. The assessments may be standardized national, state, or city assessments or your own self-created assessments. The assessment data can be provided in any form that you choose (official documents with students' last names crossed-out, or documents that you create to summarize student assessment performance). The data you provide should ideally show progress over time; as such, it is recommended (though not required) that you provide data for at least two assessments taken at different points in time. The assessment data must be accompanied by a copy of the assessments themselves. If a specific assessment is unavailable, provide a copy of a similar assessment. The assessment data must also be accompanied by a written narrative that provides background on the assessments, explains how the assessments measure student performance, and analyzes the results of your class. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.
4. ORIGINAL CURRICULAR TOOL: Please submit one original curricular tool of any form that you have personally developed. The requirement here is deliberately open-ended because we are interested in seeing anything that you have developed that you believe has meaningfully supported your students' learning. This may take the form of written materials, a unique instructional methodology, a technological innovation, etc.

REPORTING RELATIONSHIP
Our teachers are an integral part of our school-based instructional team and report to the School Director(s), with regular coaching and support from our instructional coaches and DCIs.

GREAT OAKS LEGACY PHILOSOPHY
Our students arrive, on average, significantly behind grade level. Many live in poverty – a higher percentage than most schools in the country. Upon arrival, they are statistically less than 10% likely to graduate with a 4-year degree. Our mission is that each child ultimately graduates from college.
Therefore:
Employees take responsibility to reverse negative outcomes of failing students, to make every effort to work proactively to engage each and every student, such that each is legitimately prepared to succeed in college.
It is a given that all of the faculty work very, very hard. All staff acknowledge that we will do more than just work hard; we each seek – through formal and informal feedback – to dramatically improve. At Great Oaks Legacy, an ongoing quest for improvement is not considered remedial, it is essential and ongoing for all staff.

Additional Information
GOLCS is committed to building a talented team that reflects the diverse backgrounds and experiences of our students. Our staff and student population is diverse and culturally rich. We believe that racial justice and equity is critical to our mission of preparing students for success in college and beyond. We strive to be an organization that is diverse, equitable, inclusive, and elevates our student voices in preparing them for life and college.

BACHELOR'S DEGREE PREFERRED
ARDMS, CCI or ARRT CREDENTIAL REQUIRED
Minimum of 3 YEARS FULL TIME clinical experience in ultrasound
Should have an outgoing, compassionate, enthusiastic personality.
Should have great communication skills, both verbal/written.
Able to multi-task in fast paced educational institution.
Computer literacy required including MS word, excel and power point.
You can be a part of THE CURE!
The CURE is a mission driven, state of the art, compassionate organization seeking instructors that understand the need for improved ultrasound education.
CURE has a belief that high quality, highly specialized ultrasound education can reduce the medical error in our country. With medical error being the third leading cause of death in our country, one way that we can help reduce this, is through BETTER MEDICAL EDUCATION.
CURE offers that with our highly specialized, advanced ultrasound training. CURE offers a complete, comprehensive program of sonography including general, cardiac, vascular, musculoskeletal, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology IN ONE PROGRAM. CURE does not offer tracks. We believe it is VITAL for students to learn every body system in order to become a highly knowledgeable, well rounded ""supertech."" The goal is that when students learn the anatomy, they understand all the components including how the circulatory and vascular system is affected and this leads to seeing the WHOLE picture, not just part. We believe that there are others that understand our goals that can help us foster this type of education. If you are PASSIONATE about what you do and love to teach, CURE is the place for you.
The CURE facilities are on a gorgeous campus in the heart of Westchester. We offer large classrooms, fully equipped labs, state of the art equipment, a full service cafeteria, gym, basketball court and numerous other amenities. We even have koi ponds and a beautiful area for outdoor dining.
If you have experience in the field, you are also aware of the large number of CT scans ordered instead of ultrasound. We'd like to minimize cancers caused by radiation from CT and other x-ray exams, but improving ultrasound education to encourage doctors to order more ultrasounds. We believe that through better ultrasound training, less CT scans will be ordered which can lead to an actual measurable reduction in cancers caused by CT scans. Most people aren't aware that CT scans cause more cancers every year than breast cancer. It's vital that we work together to improve ultrasound education in order to improve overall healthcare through safer and elevated ultrasound education.
If this interests you and you can relate to our mission and reason, please apply.
With the COVID crisis, we are working diligently to ensure that our staff and students are protected in this environment. Our program director is an infectious disease specialist and we have taken every precaution possible to ensure the safety of all that we can. We are seeking individuals that also have experience with distance education as we progress to apply for blended learning through our regulatory agencies. We imagine a future with lectures and even possibly some labs online, with the availability of app based machines that we are seeking to acquire for our students. This would give teachers the flexibility to work from home if they choose. We need help to make these things happen. Are you interested in learning more?
Below is a general job description. The best part about teaching is that we have already built power points, tests, lesson plans and curriculum where you can come in to share your experience and your knowledge with ease. If you have considered moving from the diagnostic world, into education, considering the crisis and the pandemic that we are all facing, this is a good time.
ALL specialities are welcome to apply. Due to state regulations, you must have 3 years of PRACTICAL working experience and you must hold at least ONE credential in ultrasound.
We have part time and full time positions available. The minimum hours is 24, working 3 days per week.
We are also seeking a clinical coordinator full time.
Here's a summary of the responsibilities:
Job Description
Adequately present CURE course materials and lesson plans.
Provide each student with CURE course content in a classroom and clinical setting.
Provide students with descriptions, expectations, evaluations, calendars and timelines for all courses.

REPORTING RELATIONSHIP
Our teachers are an integral part of our school-based instructional team and report to the School Director(s), with regular coaching and support from our instructional coaches and DCIs.

GREAT OAKS LEGACY PHILOSOPHY
Our students arrive, on average, significantly behind grade level. Many live in poverty – a higher percentage than most schools in the country. Upon arrival, they are statistically less than 10% likely to graduate with a 4-year degree. Our mission is that each child ultimately graduates from college.
Therefore:
Employees take responsibility to reverse negative outcomes of failing students, to make every effort to work proactively to engage each and every student, such that each is legitimately prepared to succeed in college.
It is a given that all of the faculty work very, very hard. All staff acknowledge that we will do more than just work hard; we each seek – through formal and informal feedback – to dramatically improve. At Great Oaks Legacy, an ongoing quest for improvement is not considered remedial, it is essential and ongoing for all staff.

Additional Information
GOLCS is committed to building a talented team that reflects the diverse backgrounds and experiences of our students. Our staff and student population is diverse and culturally rich. We believe that racial justice and equity is critical to our mission of preparing students for success in college and beyond. We strive to be an organization that is diverse, equitable, inclusive, and elevates our student voices in preparing them for life and college.
Great Oaks Legacy Charter School offers competitive salaries commensurate with experience and a comprehensive benefits package, including rich health insurance plans, professional development and coaching, and retirement benefits as part of the state pension plan.

It is a given that all of the faculty work very, very hard. All staff acknowledge that we will do more than just work hard; we each seek – through formal and informal feedback – to dramatically improve. At Great Oaks Legacy, an ongoing quest for improvement is not considered remedial, it is essential and ongoing for all staff.
